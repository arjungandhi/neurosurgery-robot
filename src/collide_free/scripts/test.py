'''
 Joint variables of the robot
   1) AxialHeadTranslation (corresponds to the delta_z_sup)
   2) AxialFeetTranslation (corresponds to the delta_z_inf )
   3) LateralTranslation (ranging from -37.5 to 0 mm)
   the first three degree of freedom of the robot positions the robot's RCM point at a target location
   4) PitchRotation (Ry ranging from -37.2 to 30.6 deg)
   5) YawRotation (Rx ranging from -90deg to 0deg)
   4 and 5 positions the needle or the probe to pass through the burr hole
   6) ProbeRotation (Rz continuous deg)
   7) ProbeInsertion (PI ranging from -40 to 0 mm)
